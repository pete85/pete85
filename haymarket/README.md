# Haymarket Test

## Technologies used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Tools
* WebStorm
* Photoshop
* Github
* [Online image compressor](https://compressor.io/)

## Assumptions
I made a mistake assuming that the task is to build a slider/scroller for 3 articles. Towards the end of the implementation I realised it was supposed to be one article with 3 pages. However, the concept works despite this misunderstanding.

## Approach
As this is a test project, I have decided not to use any frameworks or plugins, i.e. Bootstrap.

Mobile first approach [Media queries used](https://scotch.io/tutorials/default-sizes-for-twitter-bootstraps-media-queries)

### Process
1. Implementation of three objects, one for each article.
2. Pushing all objects into articles array
3. Initialising all elements (image, page number, content) to correspond to index 0 of the array
4. Implementation of page numbers visual feedback
5. Implementation of previous and next functions
6. Implementation of thew image preview
7. Clean up of the code and refactoring
