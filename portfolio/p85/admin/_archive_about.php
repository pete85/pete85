                                <span>First Experience</span>
                                In May 2005 I arrived to UK. I was planning to stay here for summer school break... I'm still here, which means that I'm having a very long summer school break.</p>

                            <p>
                                My first role, after arriving to UK, was marquee erector. I worked for an event organising company based in Yorkshire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After one year I have moved to London, where I started working in restaurants and gastro pubs. For six years I worked as a chef.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I have started the university course, I moved to construction industry. I have worked there until February 2015, when I found my first Web Developer job.

                                In 2011 I've started a Computing and Information Systems course at the University of West London. Three years later I graduated with 2:1 first division degree and started my career in Web Development.</p>

                                <span>Front End Development</span>
                                Soon after graduation, I have started my first Web Developer role in digital marketing agency in Central London. I was involved in designing and developing responsive landing pages using Bootstrap framework, implementing HTML5 dynamic banners and building email newsletters.

                            <p>
                                In May 2015 I have moved to world's leading exhibitions organising company where I was responsible for maintaining a portfolio of over 50 event websites.

                            <p>
                            	November 2016 brought another step forward in my career. I have taken the position of Front-End Developer in a rapidly growing digital marketing agency. My tasks involve building responsive websites and web applications, creating responsive email templates and implementing a variety of modern features.
